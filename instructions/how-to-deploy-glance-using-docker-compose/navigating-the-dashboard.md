## Dashboard Overview
Letâ€™s start by exploring the Glance interface:  

- **Pages (Tabs):** Each tab at the top represents a page that can contain multiple widgets.  
- **Columns:** Horizontal sections on a page. You can have full-width or small columns.  
- **Widgets:** Individual blocks that display content such as RSS feeds, Reddit posts, or YouTube videos.  


You can see here how pages, columns and widgets relate to each other:
