## Columns

Every page consists of columns.

Columns are defined for each page using a columns property. There are two types of columns - full and small, which refers to their width. A small column takes up a fixed amount of width (300px) and a full column takes up the all of the remaining width. You can have up to 3 columns per page and you must have either 1 or 2 full columns.
