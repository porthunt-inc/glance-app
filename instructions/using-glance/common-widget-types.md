## Understanding Widgets

### What Are Widgets?
Widgets are the **individual content blocks** that make up your dashboard. Each widget displays a specific type of information, such as news feeds, market data, system metrics, or videos.  

Widgets are the **building blocks of your dashboard**, and everything you see in a page comes from the widgets placed inside its columns.

### How Widgets Work
- Widgets pull data from a source (RSS feed, API, server metrics, etc.) and display it in a compact, visual format.  
- Each widget has configurable properties, like `title`, `limit` (number of items to show), and `refresh-interval`.  
- Widgets automatically adjust to the size of the column they are in, so placement and column size affect how the widget looks.

### Adding Widgets to Columns
- Widgets are **always added inside columns**, never directly on a page.  
- Each column can hold one or multiple widgets stacked vertically.  
- Columns act as containers that organize widgets and control their width on the page.

### Examples of Built-in Widgets
- **RSS:** Shows posts from an RSS feed  
- **Reddit:** Displays posts from a subreddit  
- **YouTube:** Shows videos from a channel  
- **Markets:** Tracks stock or cryptocurrency prices  
- **Server Stats:** Displays CPU, memory, and other system metrics  

> [!NOTE]
> Think of a page as a canvas, columns as containers, and widgets as the content blocks you fill the canvas with. By combining columns and widgets, you can create highly customized dashboards.
